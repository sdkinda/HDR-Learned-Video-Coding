# Introduction
Our paper [High Dynamic Range Video Compression: A Large-Scale Benchmark Dataset and A Learned Bit-depth Scalable Compression Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00410) has been accepted by CVPR2025.



## Update
* 2025.03.04: Upload Benchmark of the HDRVD2K, JVET, HDM datasets.
* Code of LBSVC and compression details of traditional codecs will be presented later.

## Datasets
Our HDRVD2K contains 2164 HDR video clips and each clip includes 15 frames, whose resolution are all 1920x1080 and format are all 16-bit floating .exr. Two test datasets JVET (6 sequences) and HDM (select 10 sequences from all 34 sequnces) are presented. Datasets can be downloaded in [BaiduNetdisk](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1xPqDj3Fn9meQ7sj-E7_Jqg?pwd=T710). Our dataset is available for the academic purpose only.
